          <h2>Outsourcing Creates a Level Playing Field</h2>
          <p>
            A common misconception is that outsourcing custom software
            development is just for big startups with large budgets. Outsourcing
            can benefit a leaner, more streamlined startup by freeing up the
            time and talent that the founders bring to the table. Since
            outsourcing allows any brand to access skilled teams, (that they
            don’t have to hire, train and employ fulltime), this process creates
            a truly level playing field and ensures a new brand can compete in
            even the most competitive of fields.

          <h2>Scaling up</h2>
          <p>
            The typical startup moves swiftly and your needs may change rapidly.
            Scalability is an important factor when it comes to any service or
            task you are paying someone for – whether you are paying an employee
            or outsourcing. When you can’t easily scale up or down, you end up
            paying for more services than you use (or not being able to access
            needed services because you lack the ability to keep up with demand.
            <br />
            Outsourcing is designed to be scalable, since a software development
            company needs to be able to meet the needs of brands of all sizes.
            This allows your brand to access the services it needs, when it
            needs them, without overpaying or buying more than you need.

          <h2>Cost Saving</h2>
          <p>
            The right software development company can provide you with services
            that rival or improve upon what an inhouse team can provide, but at
            a much lower cost.When you outsource your startups software
            development, the company you work with will handle these tasks – and
            cope with the legal side of hiring, paying and managing workers.
            You’ll also have access to a full team of workers instead of a sole
            employee. Even the most dedicated employee takes time off, gets sick
            or goes on vacation – and your development could stall while that
            happens. Working with a team ensures your development keeps moving
            forward.

          <h2>Hiring top-notch specialists</h2>
          <p>
            If we think about the long-term perspective for businesses, scarcity
            of the resources means that you have to prioritize. This is
            particularly relevant to IT-related tasks. Another important point
            is that newborn companies often don’t have enough hands to solve
            their challenging tasks effectively. A startup may have a brilliant
            idea, and its CEO may be very ambitious, but even the most talented
            specialist cannot build a company alone. The third problem follows
            from the fact that startup projects are often based on innovative
            business ideas. This often means a lack of know-how both in the
            development team and in the local market in general.

          <h2>Starting fast</h2>
          <p>
            You may have the most innovative idea and be very passionate about
            bringing it to life. Yet, if you don’t get your product to market
            quickly, you’ve lost the game. There are a number of circumstances
            that make the time to market speed a critical element of startup
            success. First, if you deliver your product quickly, it gives you a
            big advantage over your competitors. Secondly, fast TTM serves as
            proof of the reliability of your startup for angels and venture
            funds (the quicker you deliver your product to the market, the more
            chances you have to beat your rivals and return money to investors).
            And finally, fast TTM is of particular importance for startups
            entering some “hype industry” in which each day of delay can be your
            last day in the market.

          <h2>Innovation</h2>
          <p>
            There are a number of instances when outsourcing innovation is a
            viable and attractive option. An innovation laboratory focuses on
            building and testing, retargeting budget as necessary and scaling
            the team as appropriate, all without time-consuming board or
            committee approval. This limited hierarchy also frees up staff to
            think creatively and eschews the fear of failure that inhibits large
            companies.From a purely practical point of view, outsourcing the
            process of innovation is usually the most cost-effective option.
            Innovating in-house is an expensive process with capacity and time
            consumed prodigiously. Hiring and keeping top talent is an
            incredibly hard task and can drive up costs further.
